This script parses the input from any HTML form. Among others it can process input from forms that were created using SurveyWiz (Copyright: Michael Birnbaum). 
This script creates a MySQL DB and one table in it (if not yet present) containing columns that are named according to the variables that were submitted with the HTML form. 
The table columns and later their input are created/entered in alphabetical/numerical order. For easier identification of users (especially if several people use the same script) 
the referer variable indicates which HTML form sent the data.
